          <h4 class="about-title">Understand who I am as a person</h4>
          <p class="about-text">
            I’m an aspiring developer based in Toronto and just finished my second year of studies in Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo. My passion in every aspect of technology, along with my desire to make a difference in the world with what I do led me to pursue an education in engineering. Due to the diversity of my program, and past co-ops, I have gained knowledge and experience in various fields of engineering. I have worked at companies that have 4 employees and a very specific product, and I have worked at companies that have over 300,000 employees worldwide with products in every industry imaginable. I have worked on electrical projects, and software projects, and mechanical projects. Having exposure to such diverse work cultures and experiences at such an early point in my career is something rather unique about me.
          </p>
          <p class="about-text">
           However, as the saying goes “A jack of all trades is a master of none”, I have particularly gained keen interest in software engineering, reflected in my past couple co-op placements. In my current co-op, I am working with a team who is responsible for the development and maintenance of IBM’s crown-jewel security product, QRadar. I am actively resolving critical customer facing issues by debugging software defects and ensuring all bugs and new features are implemented for each scheduled release. This co-op, along with my last one at Manulife, has allowed me to accomplish my goal of working on projects that have genuine impact in the world. I am now looking for a 4-month co-op opportunity from May 2018 – August 2018 to continue my journey as an aspiring engineer.

          When I’m not in class, working on assignments and projects, or doing co-op work, you will find me travelling with my family or friends, planning vacations I’m going to take 50 years in the future, watching videos of corgis for hours on YouTube, or just watching all my favorite shows on Netflix. One of my goals is to step foot in every single continent in the world, Antarctica included!
